# GymOps 🏋️‍♂️

**GymOps** is a modern, web-based gym management system designed to help gym owners and staff streamline their day-to-day operations — from managing memberships to tracking member activity.  
This project was developed during my internship as a hands-on way to explore and learn **SvelteKit** and **Golang**.

## 📌 The Problem

Many gyms still rely on manual processes or outdated systems, leading to:

- Inefficient member and subscription tracking
- Outdated or incomplete member records
- Limited insight into gym performance and member activity
- Lack of a centralized system for staff coordination

---

## 💡 The Solution

**GymOps** solves these problems by providing a centralized platform with features such as:

- 🧾 Member registration and management
- 🕐 Automated membership expiration tracking and notifications
- 📊 Real-time dashboard with analytics and trends
- 🔒 Secure authentication

By digitizing gym operations, GymOps reduces administrative overhead, minimizes errors, and improves operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Motivation

With the rise in fitness awareness, gyms — especially small to medium-sized ones — face increasing demands that traditional tools can’t keep up with.  
GymOps was built to empower these gyms with a modern, cost-effective solution that helps them stay competitive without relying on expensive commercial software.
